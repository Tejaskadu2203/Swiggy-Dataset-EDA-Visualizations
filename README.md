# Swiggy-Dataset-EDA-Visualizations
This project performs an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a simulated Swiggy food-delivery dataset using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It uncovers insights about order patterns, delivery trends, outlet performance, item categories, customer behavior, and revenue distribution to support data-driven decision-making.
