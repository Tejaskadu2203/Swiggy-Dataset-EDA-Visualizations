A simple data analysis project where I explored a simulated Swiggy food-delivery dataset using Python.
The goal was to understand customer trends, restaurant performance, and delivery behaviour using Pandas and visualizations.

🔍 What I Did

1) Cleaned and prepared the dataset
2) Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3) Created visualizations for trends and patterns
4) Identified top cuisines, delivery insights, and rating behaviour
5) Generated meaningful business insights

🛠️ Tools Used

1) Python
2) Pandas
3) Matplotlib and Seaborn
